# Mobile app

Set of classes for contacts
===========================

You are working on an mobile application for text messaging, similar to WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc. Propose and implement a set of classes to represent contacts from the contact list in the app. There are two kinds of contacts: 
- Users, which you chat with individually
- Groups (aka named chat rooms), where multiple users chat together.

The interface requirements for your classes are defined by a test suite comprising test_user.cpp and test_groups.cpp modules. You can extend the test suite as needed but you should not modify existing tests.
