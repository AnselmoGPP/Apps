# Distance between cities

Problem: 
We have the names of some cities and distances from our position. These cities are all along a straight line. We want a program that outputs the diference of distance between each other, from the nearests to the furthest (the first distance is from us to the nearest city, the second distance is from that city to the second nearer city, and so on). Examples (input and output):
