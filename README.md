# Apps

This is a set of relatively small applications made for very different purposes.

The apps contained here are:

- Binary_converter: Translator from binary to decimal and viceversa.
- Roman_converter: Converts decimal numbers to roman numerals and viceversa, checks if a certain roman numeral exists, and displays a list of numerals in a specified range. 
- Pass_breaker: Given a set of different possible characters, uses brute force to get the correct password.
