# Distance between 2 points

Description:
You have (x, y) coordinates for 2 points and need to find the distance between them.

Input:
Your program should read lines from standard input. Each line contains two space-delimited coordinate pairs. All x and y values are integers between -100 and 100.

Output:
Print the distance between the two points. You do not need to round the results you receive.

Examples of inputs and outputs:
(25, 4) (1, -6)
26

(47, 43) (-25, -11)
90
